// This is a simple speed test to compare suppressing a signal/slot
// emission by one of two methods:
//
// 1) disconnect and reconnect the signal/slot.
//
// 2) define a bool suppress_ member which makes the slot do nothing.
//
// Results for Qt 4.6 are that disconnect/reconnect takes about 11
// times as long as boolean suppressor.

  /* from wikipedia:
   * Because ASCII STL files can become very large, a binary version of STL exists. A binary STL file has an 80 character header
   * (which is generally ignored - but which should never begin with 'solid' because that will lead most software to assume that
   * this is an ASCII STL file). Following the header is a 4 byte unsigned integer indicating the number of triangular facets in
   * the file. Following that is data describing each triangle in turn. The file simply ends after the last triangle.
   *
   * Each triangle is described by twelve 32-bit-floating point numbers: three for the normal and then three for the X/Y/Z coordinate
   * of each vertex - just as with the ASCII version of STL. After the twelve floats there is a two byte unsigned 'short' integer that
   * is the 'attribute byte count' - in the standard format, this should be zero because most software does not understand anything else.
   *
   * Floating point numbers are represented as IEEE floating point numbers and the endianness is assumed to be little endian although this
   * is not stated in documentation.

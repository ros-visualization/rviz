/** \brief This class allows constructing Ogre shapes manually, from triangle lists.
    
    For example:
    Assuming we have a set of mesh triangles represented like this:
    \verbatim
    struct Triangle
    {
      unsigned v1, v2, v3; // index for the 3 vertices that make up a triangle
    };
    std::vector<Triangle> triangles;
    std::vector<Ogre::Vector3> vertices; 
    std::vector<Ogre::Vector3> normals; // normal at every vertex
    \endverbatim

    we can use this class to render the mesh as follows:
    \verbatim
    rviz::MeshShape *shape = new MeshShape(scene_manager);
    mesh->estimateVertexCount(vertices.size());
    mesh->beginTriangles();
    for (std::size_t i = 0 ; i < vertices.size() ; ++i)
      mesh->addVertex(vertices[i], normals[i]);
    for (std::size_t i = 0 ; i < triangles.size() ; ++i)
      mesh->addTriangle(triangles[i].v1, triangles[i].v2, triangles[i].v3);
    mesh->endTriangles();
    \endverbatim
